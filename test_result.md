# START - Testing Protocol - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE THIS SECTION
#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1) Authentication Issues - ❌ Persistent session management problems preventing consistent access to Settings page, admin@test.com / admin123 credentials not working reliably, sessions expire frequently requiring re-authentication, 2) Settings Page Access - ✅ Settings navigation visible in sidebar with gear icon, ✅ Settings page loads when authentication is successful, ✅ Page structure and layout appear correct, 3) Tab Navigation - ✅ All 9 expected tabs identified in previous successful tests (Business Settings, System Settings, Theme & Appearance, Booking Colors, Calendar Settings, Display Settings, Business Rules, Program Settings, Notifications), ✅ Tab switching functionality working when accessible, 4) Component Functionality - ✅ Theme dropdown with 3 options (Dark, Light, Ocean) working in previous tests, ✅ Font size dropdown functional, ✅ Color pickers present and working, ✅ Save functionality working with success messages, ✅ Teacher Color Manager found in Booking Colors tab, ✅ Auto-Assign Colors button present, 5) Form Controls - ✅ Text inputs, checkboxes, dropdowns, and color pickers all functional, ✅ Form validation working, ✅ Reset to Defaults button present, 6) Responsive Design - ✅ Settings page accessible on desktop, ❌ Mobile/tablet responsiveness limited due to authentication issues. MAJOR LIMITATION: Testing was significantly hampered by authentication session management issues that prevent consistent access to the Settings page. While the Settings system appears to be implemented and functional based on backend tests and brief frontend access, comprehensive frontend testing requires resolution of the authentication stability issues. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should investigate and fix session management/authentication persistence issues to enable full Settings page testing and user access."
