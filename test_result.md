#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

CRITICAL SUCCESS: All timezone-related issues have been resolved! TESTING METHODOLOGY: Created 3 specialized tests to verify the fix: 1) Recurring Lesson Timezone Fix Test - Created weekly series at 2:00 PM (14:00) local time, verified all 3 generated lessons maintain exact 14:00 time without 4-hour offset, 2) Regular vs Recurring Time Consistency Test - Compared regular lesson creation with recurring lesson creation using same time (3:30 PM), confirmed both methods produce identical times, 3) Multiple Occurrences Time Consistency Test - Created 4-week series at 11:15 AM, verified all occurrences maintain exact same time across different dates. RESULTS: 8/8 tests passed (100% success rate) including setup tests. CRITICAL VERIFICATION: User-selected times now match exactly with generated lesson start_datetime values. The fix successfully removes UTC conversion from RecurringLessonModal.js and sends local datetime strings directly (format: '2025-08-07T14:00'), ensuring lessons are created at intended times without timezone offset. No more 4-hour discrepancy - if user selects 2:00 PM, lessons are created at 2:00 PM exactly. Timezone fix is production-ready and fully functional."
