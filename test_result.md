# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Applied complete fix: 1) Updated REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL to correct Railway URL, 2) Rebuilt React app with correct environment variables, 3) Added comprehensive Railway build configuration (railway.json with buildCommand), 4) Created build.sh script that ensures React build includes Railway URL and verifies deployment artifacts, 5) Confirmed build process works locally and includes correct Railway URL in compiled JavaScript. Railway deployment should now work correctly with proper static file serving."

      message: "🔄 NEW RECURRING LESSON & WEBSOCKET FEATURES TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing of newly implemented recurring lesson and real-time update features. CRITICAL FINDINGS: All existing functionality continues to work perfectly (48/59 tests passed). However, the new features have deployment issues: 1) Recurring Lesson API endpoints (POST/GET/DELETE /api/recurring-lessons) return 405/404 errors and are not accessible despite being defined in server.py, 2) WebSocket real-time updates at /ws/{user_id} fail with handshake errors, returning HTML instead of WebSocket upgrade, 3) All 7 recurring lesson tests failed, 4) All 4 WebSocket tests failed. The code appears correctly implemented but there are deployment/configuration issues preventing these new features from working in the Railway environment. Existing notification system, delete functionality, and all core CRM features remain fully functional."
