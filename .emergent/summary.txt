The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Dance Studio CRM from an MVP to a more feature-rich application. Key accomplishments include fixing a frontend  syntax error, implementing a comprehensive lesson cancellation system with reporting, and dynamic booking color management. A floating  was introduced for real-time financial data, alongside an enhanced  with detailed financial tracking and student names. A lesson credit system was also established.

The current trajectory details the transition of work and addresses new user requests. The primary focus for the new engineer started with debugging a lesson history display issue within the . During this process, it was identified that the API call for lesson history lacked authentication headers, which was subsequently fixed in . Concurrently, the user requested adding student names to the enrollment overview and linking enrollments to the student ledger for better clarity. The engineer's immediate next step, as the trajectory concluded, was to enhance the backend's  endpoint by creating a new Pydantic response model to directly include student names, avoiding redundant frontend fetches. The fix for lesson history has been applied but not yet verified.

<product_requirements>
The Dance Studio CRM is a dark-themed, glassmorphism platform supporting multi-role authentication, lesson scheduling (daily/weekly calendar, drag-and-drop, deletion), student/teacher management, and an enrollment system for 12 dance programs. Core functionalities include calendar navigation, recurring lesson management, instructor statistics, weekly lesson deletion, time offsets, and enhanced lesson creation/editing.

Recent feature additions, leading up to the current state, include:
1.  **Lesson Cancellation System**: Ability to cancel/reactivate lessons, track statuses, and generate reports.
2.  **Dynamic Booking Colors**: Configurable color management for different booking types/statuses.
3.  **Floating Student Ledger Panel**: Accessible from lesson displays, showing real-time financial updates, lesson credits (, ), and lesson history.
4.  **Enhanced Enrollments Page**: Display of , , , and / per enrollment, along with student names.
5.  **Lesson Credit System**: Automatic deduction of lesson credits upon attendance.
6.  **Lesson History View**: Display of past and future lessons within the ledger panel, with navigation to specific dates and attendance marking.

The user's latest explicit requests include:
1.  **Debugging Lesson History**: Resolve the issue where the lesson history list is not rendering in  after clicking View All Lessons.
2.  **Student Names in Enrollment Overview**: Display student names directly on the enrollment tab to prevent ambiguity.
3.  **Link Enrollments to Student Ledger**: Integrate multiple enrollments for a student directly within their ledger for easier management.
4.  **Manual Frontend Testing**: Perform manual testing of the frontend after fixes and new feature implementations.

        -   Converted from modal to floating panel.
        -   Displays lesson credit (, ) and integrates lesson history.
        -   **Latest Change**: Modified  function (lines 164-171) to include authentication headers in the  call, resolving the Not authenticated error for the lesson history API.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on enhancing the enrollment system to display student names directly within the enrollment overview and link enrollments to the student ledger. This followed an initial debugging phase for the lesson history feature in the .

The specific actions taken include:
1.  **Debugging Lesson History**: The engineer identified that the  function in  was failing due to a lack of authentication headers in its  call. This was addressed by adding  to the  call and including  headers if a token is available. This fix (Chat Message 51) was applied but its successful resolution of the rendering issue is yet to be verified.
2.  **Addressing Enrollment Display**: The engineer reviewed  and  to understand how enrollment data and student names are currently handled. It was determined that student names are fetched separately in the frontend using  rather than being part of the initial enrollment data.
3.  **Planning Enrollment Backend Enhancement**: To streamline the enrollment display, the engineer decided to modify the backend. The immediate next step identified was to create a new Pydantic response model in  to augment the  endpoint's response, embedding student details directly into the enrollment objects. This would eliminate the need for redundant frontend calls to fetch student names.
