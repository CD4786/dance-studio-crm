The trajectory details the transition of work from an AI engineer who built the Dance Studio CRM's MVP, to a new AI engineer. The initial phase focused on three explicit user requests: debugging lesson history in , displaying student names on the , and linking enrollments to the student ledger. The engineer successfully fixed the lesson history authentication issue and, after extensive backend and frontend modifications (creating a new Pydantic model for , updating  and ), implemented the student name display and ledger linking, including significant UI/UX improvements. Backend and frontend tests confirmed these features.

Upon completion of the initial requests, the user immediately requested enhancing the weekly calendar with attendance marking and day navigation. The engineer implemented these features by modifying the  component in  and updating  for styling. Frontend testing verified this functionality. The latest user interaction points out a UI/UX issue: lesson action buttons (edit, delete) are only visible on hover. The engineer identified the root cause in  and is planning a solution.

<product_requirements>
The Dance Studio CRM is a dark-themed, glassmorphism platform for managing a dance studio, featuring multi-role authentication, lesson scheduling (daily/weekly calendar, drag-and-drop, deletion), student/teacher management, and an enrollment system for 12 dance programs.

Recent feature additions:
1.  **Lesson Cancellation System**: Cancel/reactivate lessons, track statuses, generate reports.
2.  **Dynamic Booking Colors**: Configurable colors for booking types/statuses.
3.  **Floating Student Ledger Panel**: Real-time financial updates, lesson credits (, ), and lesson history.
4.  **Enhanced Enrollments Page**: Display of , , , ,  per enrollment, and student names.
5.  **Lesson Credit System**: Automatic deduction of credits upon attendance.
6.  **Lesson History View**: Past/future lessons in ledger panel, navigation, attendance marking.

The user's latest explicit requests and feedback:
1.  **Debugging Lesson History**: Resolve non-rendering lesson history in .
2.  **Student Names in Enrollment Overview**: Display student names directly.
3.  **Link Enrollments to Student Ledger**: Integrate multiple enrollments for a student directly within their ledger.
4.  **Manual Frontend Testing**: Perform testing after implementations.
5.  **Weekly Calendar Enhancements**: Mark lessons attended and navigate to specific lesson dates from the weekly calendar.
6.  **UI/UX Improvement for Calendar Buttons**: Make lesson action buttons (edit, delete) visible without hovering, and organize them better.

<code_architecture>


-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Core backend API logic, FastAPI routing, MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Created  Pydantic model to include student details (name, email) within enrollment objects.
        -   Modified the  endpoint (lines 1258-1288) to fetch student names from the database using  and embed them directly into the enrollment response, eliminating the need for separate frontend calls.
        -   Ensured the endpoint returns .
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Displays student financial ledger and lesson history as a floating panel.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Modified  function (lines 164-171 in original context) to include authentication headers ( and  token) in the  call, resolving a Not authenticated error.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Manages and displays student enrollments.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Updated to consume student names directly from the enhanced  backend response, removing the  helper function.
        -   Implemented UI/UX improvements for enrollment cards, including glassmorphism effects, enhanced lesson credit display, financial information layout, and better responsiveness.
        -   Added a ðŸ’° Ledger button to each enrollment card for direct access to the student ledger.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Main React application component, handles routing, global state, and renders various pages including calendars and enrollments.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Updated to pass the  function to  to enable direct linking to the student ledger.
        -   Modified the  component implementation to include attendance marking functionality and navigation to specific days. This involved adding new state variables and handlers for these actions.
        -   The frontend testing agent retrospectively moved  state management to the  level for universal access across components after the initial attempt by the AI engineer had issues with finding the correct global state.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Contains global and component-specific CSS styling for the application.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Added enhanced CSS styling for enrollment cards, including glassmorphism effects, gradient borders, and hover animations, as well as specific styles for lesson credit display and financial information layout.
        -   Updated styles for the weekly calendar (, ) to accommodate new action buttons for attendance and navigation, and to improve overall layout and visual appearance.
        -   Identified the styling for  (lines 1316-1324) which currently sets , causing buttons to be invisible unless hovered.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Records user problem statements, testing data, and agent communications.
    -   **Changes**: Regularly updated with reported issues, debugging steps, and testing outcomes, including detailed summaries of backend and frontend test results.

<pending_tasks>
-   Improve the UI/UX for lesson action buttons on the calendar, making them visible without hovering and better organized, as identified from the user's latest feedback.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback regarding the visibility of action buttons (edit, delete, etc.) on the weekly calendar. The user reported that these buttons were only visible on hover, leading to a poor user experience.

The engineer's actions involved:
1.  **Acknowledging User Feedback**: The engineer confirmed the user's observation about invisible buttons.
2.  **Code Inspection**: The engineer examined  and identified the specific CSS rules ( for  at lines 1316-1324 in the  file read) that caused the buttons to be hidden until hovered.
3.  **Planning a Solution**: The engineer decided to implement a solution that makes the most important actions always visible while reorganizing secondary actions for better usability.

This task is in its initial analysis phase, with the problem identified and a general approach planned, but no code changes have been committed yet to address this specific UI/UX issue.

<optional_next_step>
I will proceed to modify  to improve the visibility and organization of lesson action buttons in the weekly calendar.
