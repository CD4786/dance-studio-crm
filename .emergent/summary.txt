The AI engineer began by identifying a significant discrepancy between the provided  description and the actual codebase, which was a barebones application. Consequently, it undertook a full-stack re-implementation of the comprehensive CRM features, including an authenticated React frontend with a modern UI, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB integration. This involved extensive dependency resolution (e.g., Unknown command: "ERESOLVE"

  npm help), UI/UX refinement (glassmorphism, animated gradients), and core CRM functionalities like student/teacher management, lesson scheduling, enrollment, attendance, and a reminder system. A major focus was iterative debugging and adapting to user feedback, culminating in successful local operation. The final phase involved deploying the application to Railway, a process fraught with environmental and configuration challenges (Docker memory issues, incorrect MongoDB URLs), which were systematically debugged and addressed.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal was to build a comprehensive dance studio management application, akin to . Key requirements included a highly visual and interactive ultra-modern 2025 SaaS app UI/UX with dark theme, glassmorphism, and animated gradients. Core functional needs involved multi-role authentication (Owner, Manager, Teacher), a scheduling system featuring a daily calendar (9:00 am - 9:00 pm blocks per instructor) for private lessons, drag-and-drop functionality for lessons, and lesson deletion. Further requirements evolved to include a comprehensive dashboard, full student and teacher management (add/delete), an enrollment system for lesson packages, automatic lesson deduction upon attendance, and a weekly calendar view. The system also needed email and SMS reminder capabilities for scheduled lessons.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, utilizing MongoDB as its database. The core structure is:



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central backend logic, API endpoints, and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Completely rewritten from a basic version to include comprehensive CRM features. It now contains Pydantic models for , , , , and . New CRUD endpoints were added for these entities, alongside enhanced dashboard statistics, lesson attendance tracking, and integration points for email/SMS reminders using Twilio/TextBelt. Static file serving logic was integrated to serve the React build. Environment variables are accessed via .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Specifies Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously updated to include necessary libraries such as , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores critical backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**: Expanded from just  to include , , , , and . It was a frequent source of debugging, requiring careful adjustment for local vs. deployed URLs.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component that orchestrates the entire frontend user interface.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent extensive iterative changes and re-implementation. It now defines  for global authentication, , and  (the primary authenticated wrapper).  dynamically renders , , , , and . It integrates logic for managing students and teachers, scheduling lessons (with drag-and-drop), handling enrollments and attendance, and sending reminders. Key fixes involved adding robust null checks for  data and precise timezone handling for lesson scheduling.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the application's visual aesthetics.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified across iterations to implement a modern, dark-themed UI with glassmorphism effects, animated gradient backgrounds, custom component styling, and responsive design, targeting a 2025 modern SaaS app look.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages Node.js dependencies and frontend build/start scripts.
    -   **Changes**: Frequently updated to resolve Unknown command: "ERESOLVE"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help dependency conflicts, remove unused packages (e.g., , Radix UI components, ), and adjust build scripts from  to  for stability.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores the  for frontend API calls.
    -   **Changes**: A critical file during debugging, as its value (toggling between local  and a cloud preview URL) caused connectivity issues until consistently configured for the correct environment.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Specifies how the application's Docker image is built for containerized deployment.
    -   **Changes**: Simplified multiple times to overcome Railway's memory/timeout issues, eventually being removed entirely in favor of Railway's auto-detection.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Configures Railway-specific deployment settings.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to define explicit build and start commands, and later modified to use a simpler  script for more reliable auto-detection.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A minimal Python script designed to explicitly start the FastAPI server, crucial for Railway's simplified deployment approach.
    -   **Changes**: Created to provide a direct entry point for the backend, circumventing complex Docker build issues.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fix blank page on Railway deployment**: The deployed application URL () shows a blank page.
-   **Debug static file serving on Railway**: The API endpoints (e.g., , ) are functional, but the frontend static files (HTML, JS, CSS) are not being correctly served from the root URL.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The application is a comprehensive Dance Studio CRM with full-stack capabilities, locally running perfectly. It supports multi-role authentication, student and teacher management (including add/delete), daily and weekly scheduling with private lessons, drag-and-drop functionality for lessons, enrollment packages, attendance tracking, and reminder systems (email and real SMS via Twilio). The UI features a modern 2025 SaaS app aesthetic with a dark theme, glassmorphism effects, and animated gradients.

The immediate work involved deploying this application to Railway. While the deployment itself was eventually successful after overcoming numerous Docker and configuration challenges (like Unknown command: "ERESOLVE"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help errors, build memory issues, and MongoDB connection string  errors), the live application at  is currently displaying a blank page. Debugging confirmed that backend API endpoints (e.g., , ) are functional and the Twilio client is initialized successfully on the deployed server, indicating the backend is running. However, the frontend static files (HTML, CSS, JS) are not being served correctly from the root URL. The last action was an attempt to modify  to ensure correct static file serving for the React build.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to correctly configure the FastAPI backend to serve the compiled React frontend static files from the root URL on Railway, resolving the blank page issue.
