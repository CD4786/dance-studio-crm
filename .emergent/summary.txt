The AI engineer has significantly evolved the Dance Studio CRM from an MVP state, addressing critical bugs and implementing substantial new features. The initial phase focused on resolving a frontend syntax error related to the  component and  scope. Subsequent major additions include a comprehensive lesson cancellation system with status tracking and reporting, dynamic booking color management with a dedicated frontend component, and a floating student ledger panel integrated directly into lesson displays for real-time financial management. The Enrollments page was enhanced with price-per-lesson tracking, payment allocation, and student names. A robust lesson credit system was implemented, linking attendance to paid lessons. The current work involves adding a lesson history view within the student ledger panel with navigation capabilities, which is presently being debugged due to the lesson history list not displaying after the toggle button is clicked.

<product_requirements>
The Dance Studio CRM aims to be a modern, dark-themed, glassmorphism platform for multi-role authentication, lesson scheduling (daily/weekly calendar, drag-and-drop, deletion), dashboard, student/teacher management, and an enrollment system for 12 dance programs. Previous requests included calendar navigation, recurring lesson fixes, instructor stats, weekly lesson deletion, time offsets, precise booking, enhanced lesson creation, Settings page functionality, User Management, and lesson time editing. Recent explicit requests within this trajectory focused on implementing a lesson cancellation system with status tracking and reporting, dynamic and configurable booking colors, a floating student ledger panel accessible from lesson displays for real-time financial updates, adding price-per-lesson and payment allocation to the Enrollments page along with student names, a lesson credit system where attendance deducts from paid lessons, and a lesson history view within the ledger panel with date navigation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively implementing a **Lesson History & Navigation System** within the existing  component. The goal was to display all past and future lessons for a student, allow marking attendance for past lessons, and enable navigation to a specific day on the calendar by clicking a lesson.

The backend was updated with a new endpoint to fetch all lessons for a student. On the frontend, the  was modified to include a Lesson History section with a toggle button. The component was supposed to fetch and display the lesson history when the toggle button is clicked. A  prop was added to the  and passed from  to allow clicking on a lesson to change the displayed date on the main calendar.

The work is currently stalled because the user reported: i see recent lesson history but i do not see view all lessons. Debugging revealed that while the View All Lessons button is visible and clickable, the actual list of lessons within the history section is not rendering or becoming visible. The  function and  state management are being investigated as potential causes. The last tool call was a screenshot and console log capture to further diagnose the issue in the .
