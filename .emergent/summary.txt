The AI engineer iteratively enhanced the Dance Studio CRM, progressing from critical bug fixes to significant feature additions. Initially, the focus was on resolving a frontend syntax error related to  and . Following this, a comprehensive student search and filtering system was implemented. The engineer then tackled a multi-faceted task to make the Settings page fully functional, including theme, font, and calendar settings, and resolved an underlying issue with boolean value interpretation from the backend. The daily calendar view, initially broken due to backend API issues, was thoroughly debugged and fixed. Subsequently, dashboard navigation was made clickable, and a new Enrollments management page was created. A robust Gmail SMTP-based email notification system was integrated, followed by enhancements for granular recipient control and notification preferences. Performance was significantly improved with real-time WebSocket updates and optimized caching for faster calendar booking display. The trajectory concludes with the implementation of a lesson cancellation system with status tracking and a cancelled lessons report, currently halted by a persistent frontend syntax error in the  component, which the engineer is actively troubleshooting.

<product_requirements>
The Dance Studio CRM aims to be a modern platform with a dark theme and glassmorphism, supporting multi-role authentication, lesson scheduling (daily/weekly calendar, drag-and-drop, deletion), a dashboard, student/teacher management, and an enrollment system with 12 dance programs. Explicit requests during this trajectory included daily/weekly calendar navigation, fixing recurring lessons, instructor lesson statistics, accurate stat calculations, weekly lesson deletion, correcting 4-hour time offsets, precise lesson booking, and enhanced lesson creation with date pickers, booking types (Private, Meeting, Training, Party), and multi-instructor assignments. Further, a comprehensive Settings page (for program, theme, and system configuration), a User Management page for login and access control, and lesson time editing were requested. Most recently, the user requested: a student search/filter system, fully functional settings components (theme, font, calendar, display), dashboard cards that navigate to respective pages, a new Enrollments page with CRUD, faster calendar updates for new bookings, a lesson cancellation system that frees up slots but marks lessons as cancelled, and a report for cancelled lessons.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively implementing a new feature set for **Lesson Cancellation and Reporting**. This involves modifying the backend to track lesson status (booked, cancelled, completed) and creating new API endpoints for cancelling, reactivating, and reporting cancelled lessons. On the frontend, the engineer was adapting the daily calendar to visually mark cancelled lessons while ensuring their time slots become available for new bookings. A new  component was created to display a comprehensive list of all cancelled lessons.

The work is currently stalled due to a **persistent syntax error** in , specifically related to the  component around line 1024-1026. The  identified the root cause as mixed implicit and explicit return syntax within the  component, causing JSX parsing issues. The engineer's last action was attempting to fix this by converting the  component to an explicit return syntax and removing potential duplicate lines. The frontend is currently in a broken state due to this syntax error.
