The AI engineer successfully transitioned the Dance Studio CRM from an MVP to a robust, production-ready application. The work trajectory demonstrates an iterative development process, heavily focused on addressing user feedback and resolving complex technical issues, particularly related to date/timezone handling and UI element visibility. The engineer systematically tackled feature requests like daily/weekly calendar navigation and instructor statistics, while simultaneously debugging recurring problems such as API endpoint accessibility, frontend-backend synchronization (WebSockets), and persistent CSS visibility issues for the delete buttons. Each reported bug led to a thorough investigation, often involving inspecting code, checking server logs, and utilizing automated testing agents to verify fixes. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively implementing a significant enhancement to the lesson booking system, introducing customizable booking types and multi-instructor assignments.

The primary objective was to build a comprehensive, ultra-modern Dance Studio CRM (similar to ) with a dark theme, glassmorphism, and animated gradients. Key features initially requested and largely implemented by the previous engineer included multi-role authentication, a lesson scheduling system with daily calendar view (9 am - 9 pm blocks per instructor), drag-and-drop rescheduling, and lesson deletion.

Over time, the application evolved to include a detailed dashboard, full student and teacher management (add/delete/edit), an enrollment system supporting 12 specific dance programs with custom lesson counts, automatic lesson deduction, a weekly calendar view, email and SMS reminders, a student ledger card (enrollment, payments, lessons, edit functionality), and clickable dashboard statistics for direct navigation. During the current trajectory, the user specifically requested:
1.  Daily calendar navigation (previous/today/next day).
2.  Fixing recurring lessons functionality (API and right-click UI).
3.  Weekly calendar navigation (previous/this/next week).
4.  Instructor lesson statistics (daily/weekly/monthly totals) on the daily calendar.
5.  Fixing incorrect calculation of instructor statistics.
6.  Adding lesson deletion to the weekly calendar, with statistics updating accordingly.
7.  Fixing a 4-hour time offset when creating recurring lessons.
8.  Ensuring lessons book on the proper day (addressing a new date/timezone issue).
9.  Enhancing lesson creation to include a date picker, booking type selection (Private lesson, Meeting, Training, Party), and the ability to book multiple instructors.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes backend logic, API endpoints, MongoDB interactions, and WebSocket communication. It defines data models and CRUD operations for various entities.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Extensive debugging and fixes for recurring lesson API endpoints (404/405 errors,  serialization,  calculation, missing response fields, adding authentication).
        -   Added  enum (Private lesson, Meeting, Training, Party).
        -   Modified , ,  Pydantic models to include  and . This allows lessons to have a specific type and multiple assigned instructors. The response model was also updated.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component orchestrating the entire frontend UI, handling state, API calls, and displaying various views (calendars, managers).
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Implemented daily calendar navigation logic ( state, ,  functions) and rendering buttons.
        -   Implemented weekly calendar navigation logic.
        -   Added  function and integrated display logic into the daily calendar view for showing daily, weekly, and monthly lesson counts per instructor. This required fixing initial calculation errors and ensuring real-time updates.
        -   Integrated lesson deletion functionality for the weekly calendar by adding delete buttons and  to the UI, ensuring statistics update upon deletion.
        -   Extensively modified date handling logic across , , , and  to ensure consistent local time processing and prevent 4-hour offsets or incorrect date bookings. This involved replacing  with manual local date string construction.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the application's visual aesthetics, including the modern dark theme and glassmorphism.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Added styles for daily calendar navigation buttons (, , ).
        -   Added styles for the instructor statistics display (e.g., colored stat badges).
        -   Repeatedly modified and refined CSS for weekly lesson delete buttons to ensure they were consistently visible, clickable, and professionally styled (initially  icon, later DELETE text, and finally smaller, subtle buttons). This involved fixing visibility (, positioning) and styling issues.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: React component for creating recurring lessons.
    -   **Changes**: Removed  from datetime conversion before sending data to the backend to fix the 4-hour timezone offset issue.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Specifies Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously updated as new libraries were needed (e.g., , , , etc. as listed in initial code architecture).

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Records user problem statements, testing data, and agent communications. Crucial for tracking progress and issues.
    -   **Changes**: Frequently updated to reflect newly reported issues, debugging steps, successful fixes, and comprehensive testing results.

<current_work>
The application is a fully functional Dance Studio CRM with a modern UI. It previously supported daily/weekly calendar views, recurring lessons, student/teacher management, and financial tracking.

Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on three new features requested by the user:
1.  **Date Picker for Lesson Creation**: To give users control over the lesson date.
2.  **Booking Type Selection**: To allow categorization of bookings into Private lesson, Meeting, Training, Party.
3.  **Multiple Instructor Booking**: To enable assigning more than one instructor to a single lesson/event.

The engineer has already started implementing these features by:
-   **Backend Model Updates ()**:
    -   Defined a new  enum to categorize lessons.
    -   Modified the , , and  Pydantic models to include a  field and a  field (allowing a list of teacher IDs).
    -   Updated the response model to accommodate multiple teachers.

The current work left off right before updating the actual API endpoints in  to handle the new model structure for lesson creation. Frontend changes (date picker, booking type dropdown, multi-select for instructors) are pending the backend updates.

<optional_next_step>
Continue implementing the new lesson creation features by updating the backend API endpoints to use the new  and  fields.
