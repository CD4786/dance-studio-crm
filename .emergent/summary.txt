The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic application into a comprehensive Dance Studio CRM. The work trajectory involved multiple phases, starting with extensive debugging and fixing Railway deployment issues related to static file serving, environment variables, and Docker/Nixpacks build configurations, including Node.js version conflicts. Following deployment stabilization, the engineer implemented core CRM features such as a robust recurring lesson system with real-time WebSocket updates, a customized enrollment process supporting 12 specific dance programs with flexible lesson counts, a detailed student ledger card for tracking enrollments, payments, and lesson history, and finally, comprehensive edit functionality for student and teacher profiles, along with clickable dashboard navigation. Iterative debugging, especially concerning backend authentication logic and frontend integration, was a continuous and crucial aspect of the development process.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal was to develop a comprehensive dance studio management application, conceptually similar to , featuring an ultra-modern 2025 SaaS app UI/UX, characterized by a dark theme, glassmorphism, and animated gradients.

Initial functional requirements included:
*   Multi-role authentication (Owner, Manager, Teacher).
*   A scheduling system with a daily calendar (9:00 am - 9:00 pm blocks per instructor) for private lessons.
*   Drag-and-drop functionality for lesson rescheduling.
*   Lesson deletion capabilities.

The requirements evolved to include:
*   A comprehensive dashboard displaying key statistics.
*   Full student and teacher management (add/delete functionalities).
*   An enrollment system initially for packages, later refined to support 12 specific dance programs (e.g., Beginner Program, Full Gold) with the ability to set custom numbers of lessons for each enrollment.
*   Automatic lesson deduction upon attendance.
*   A weekly calendar view.
*   Email and SMS reminder capabilities for scheduled lessons.
*   A detailed student ledger card to display enrollment history, payment history (with ability to add and delete payments), and a record of scheduled and previous lessons.
*   The ability to edit information directly on the student ledger cards.
*   Edit functionality for information on the teachers' page.
*   Clickable dashboard statistics that navigate to the respective detailed sections (e.g., clicking Active Students navigates to the Students page, Lessons Today to the Daily Calendar).

    -   **Importance**: Centralizes backend logic, API endpoints, MongoDB interactions, and WebSocket communication.
    -   **Changes**: Extensively rewritten to include comprehensive CRM features. It now contains Pydantic models for , , , , , , , and . New CRUD endpoints were added for these entities, alongside real-time updates via WebSockets for all major operations. Authentication logic () was refined to correctly handle . Static file serving for the React build was integrated and debugged for Railway deployment.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Specifies Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously updated to include necessary libraries such as , , , , , , , , , , , and .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores critical backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**: Expanded from just  to include , , and Twilio credentials. Debugging for deployment required careful adjustment of  to be picked up from the environment.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component that orchestrates the entire frontend user interface.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent extensive iterative changes. It now defines , manages views like , , , , , and integrates the . It incorporates logic for authentication, student/teacher management (with new edit functionality), lesson scheduling, recurring lessons, enrollment (with custom dance programs), attendance, and real-time updates via WebSocket integration. Dashboard statistics were made clickable for intuitive navigation.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the application's visual aesthetics.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified to implement a modern, dark-themed UI with glassmorphism effects, animated gradient backgrounds, custom component styling, and responsive design. New styles were added for recurring lesson buttons, ledger buttons, and edit modals.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages Node.js dependencies and frontend build/start scripts.
    -   **Changes**: Frequently updated to resolve dependency conflicts (e.g., Unknown command: "ERESOLVE"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help), and to adjust build scripts and node version compatibility (Node.js 20.x).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores the  for frontend API calls.
    -   **Changes**: A critical file during deployment debugging, as its value (toggling between local and cloud URLs) needed to be consistently configured for the correct Railway environment.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Specifies how the application's Docker image is built for containerized deployment.
    -   **Changes**: Simplified multiple times, then refined into a comprehensive multi-stage build that installs Python (3.11), Node.js (20.x), yarn install v1.22.22

<current_work>
The application is a fully functional, comprehensive Dance Studio CRM with a modern 2025 SaaS app UI/UX, featuring a dark theme, glassmorphism effects, and animated gradients. It supports multi-role authentication, extensive student and teacher management (including add/delete and comprehensive edit functionalities), and a robust lesson scheduling system with daily and weekly calendar views, drag-and-drop, and lesson deletion.

Significant recent additions include:
*   **Recurring Lessons**: A comprehensive system allowing the creation of weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly recurring private lessons with flexible end conditions.
*   **Dance Programs Enrollment**: The enrollment system has been upgraded to use 12 specific dance programs (e.g., Beginner Program, Newcomers Bronze, Full Gold), enabling custom lesson counts for each student enrollment.
*   **Attendance Tracking**: Lessons can be marked as attended, automatically deducting from the student's remaining lessons in their active enrollment.
*   **Student Ledger Cards**: Each student now has a detailed ledger card, providing a complete financial and academic overview. This includes their enrollment history, payment history (with functionality to add and delete payments via multiple methods), upcoming scheduled lessons, and a record of previous lessons.
*   **Real-time Updates**: The system incorporates WebSocket integration for real-time updates across all CRUD operations (lessons, students, teachers, enrollments, payments), ensuring all connected users see live changes. A polling fallback system is also in place for environments where WebSockets might be problematic.
*   **Edit Functionality**: Comprehensive edit capabilities have been added for both student and teacher profiles. Users can now modify student information directly from their ledger cards and teacher information from the teachers' page. This involved updates to backend API endpoints (e.g., PUT /api/students/{student_id}, PUT /api/teachers/{teacher_id}) and corresponding frontend modals and forms. A critical bug related to  JSON serialization was fixed during this process, ensuring all edit operations broadcast real-time updates correctly.
*   **Dashboard Navigation**: The statistical cards on the dashboard (e.g., Active Students, Lessons Today) have been made clickable, providing direct navigation to the respective detailed sections within the application for improved user experience.

The immediate work before this summary involved successfully implementing and verifying the edit functionalities for students and teachers, and making the dashboard statistics clickable for navigation. These features have been thoroughly tested by both backend and frontend automated testing agents, confirming their operational status. The only outstanding minor detail is a session management issue affecting the consistent navigation from dashboard cards.
