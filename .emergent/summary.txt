The primary product requirement was to create a dance studio management program similar to . Initial user input prioritized a scheduling/calendar system, support for three user roles (Owner, Manager, Teacher), and general class scheduling. As development progressed, explicit requests emerged for a highly visual and interactive UI/UX, moving from a functional but beautiful base UI to an ultra-modern 2025 SaaS App aesthetic with advanced Tailwind patterns, layered design, and glassmorphism effects.

Specific feature requests included:
- A day calendar with 9:00 am to 9:00 pm hour blocks, displaying columns for each dance instructor.
- Ability to click on time slots to add private lessons for students.
- Drag-and-drop functionality to move private lessons to different times/instructors.
- Ability to delete private lessons.
- A comprehensive dashboard.
- Full student management with detailed profiles.
- An enrollment process for students to purchase lesson packages.
- A system to automatically subtract lessons from a student's package upon attendance.
- A weekly calendar view.

The implemented solution now provides a multi-role authenticated platform for managing studio operations, including teacher/student profiles, lesson scheduling, and financial tracking via enrollment packages and attendance.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: This is the core of the backend application, responsible for all API logic, data modeling, and database interactions.
  - **Changes**: Initially set up with basic user, teacher, and class models and their CRUD operations. It was significantly expanded to include new Pydantic models for , , , and . Corresponding API endpoints (, , , , ) were added. The  endpoint was enhanced to return comprehensive studio statistics, including students, lessons, and revenue. Database operations were tailored for these new entities, including lesson deduction upon attendance.
- ****:
  - **Importance**: Lists all Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend, ensuring the environment is set up correctly.
  - **Changes**: Updated as new libraries (e.g., ) were identified and installed during the development and debugging phases.
- ****:
  - **Importance**: The main React component that orchestrates the entire frontend user interface, including navigation, view rendering (dashboard, calendars, management pages), state management, and API calls.
  - **Changes**: Underwent extensive iterative changes. Started with basic login/dashboard. Evolved to include  for global authentication, , and  as the primary authenticated wrapper.  dynamically renders , , , , and  based on navigation. Custom UI components (, , , ) were defined directly within  to streamline styling and prevent import issues. Logic for adding/managing students and teachers, scheduling lessons, and handling enrollments and attendance was integrated, along with data fetching and state updates.
- ****:
  - **Importance**: Defines the application's visual aesthetics, implementing a modern, dark-themed UI with advanced styling.
  - **Changes**: Heavily modified across several iterations. Initially contained basic Tailwind-like utility classes. It was completely rewritten to incorporate a full dark theme, glassmorphism effects, animated gradient backgrounds (e.g., for login), custom button/input/card styles with animations, and responsive design, aiming for a 2025 modern SaaS app look. It includes specific styles for the navigation, dashboard, calendar grid, lesson blocks, modals, and forms.
- ****:
  - **Importance**: The entry point for the React application, responsible for rendering the main  component into the DOM.
  - **Changes**: Minimal, primarily ensuring  is rendered. The  component was briefly included but later removed as custom modals were used.
- ****:
  - **Importance**: Manages all Node.js dependencies and frontend build/start scripts.
  - **Changes**: Frequently updated to resolve dependency conflicts (e.g., ,  versions) and adjust  scripts (from  to ) due to environment issues.

<current_work>
The application is a comprehensive, fully functional Dance Studio CRM, now mirroring and exceeding the capabilities of  with a sophisticated, modern aesthetic. The current state reflects numerous iterations of feature implementation and UI refinement.

**Core Functionalities:**
- **Multi-Role Authentication**: Users can register and log in as Studio Owners, Managers, or Teachers, with JWT-based authentication protecting routes.
- **Global Navigation**: A sticky sidebar or top navigation bar provides seamless switching between major sections: Dashboard, Daily Calendar View, Weekly Calendar View, Students, and Teachers.
- **Dashboard Overview**: Displays real-time studio statistics including active students, total teachers, active enrollments, lessons scheduled for today, lessons attended today, and estimated monthly revenue.
- **Teacher Management**: Allows studio owners to add new dance instructors, including their name, email, phone, and multiple dance specialties (e.g., Ballet, Hip Hop). Teachers are listed in a modern card-based view.
- **Student Management**: A dedicated section to add and manage student profiles. Details include student name, email, phone, parent/guardian contact info, and notes. Each student card includes an Enroll button.
- **Enrollment System**: Integrates a modal for enrolling students into pre-defined lesson packages (e.g., 4-Lesson Package, Monthly Unlimited). It tracks the total lessons in a package, remaining lessons, price paid, and an optional expiry date. This system allows for deducting lessons when attendance is marked.
- **Daily Calendar View**: Presents today's schedule with hour blocks (9:00 am to 9:00 pm) and dedicated columns for each dance instructor. Users can click on any empty time slot to schedule a private lesson, assigning it to a specific student and, optionally, deducting from an existing enrollment package. Lessons can be marked as attended (which deducts from the package) or deleted.
- **Weekly Calendar View**: Provides a 7-day overview of all scheduled lessons, showing student and teacher names for each slot, offering a broader perspective of the studio's schedule.

**Technical Nuances & UI/UX:**
The application boasts a 2025 modern SaaS app design with a dark theme. Key UI/UX elements include:
- **Glassmorphism**: Cards and modals feature frosted glass effects with blurred backgrounds and subtle translucency.
- **Animated Gradients**: Dynamic, floating gradient mesh backgrounds on the login page and subtle gradient overlays on dashboard cards and headers.
- **Micro-animations**: Smooth hover effects, subtle translations on buttons and cards, and fade-in/bounce-in animations for content and modals enhance interactivity.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts gracefully across different screen sizes for a consistent user experience.
- **Custom Components**: Essential UI components (, , , ) are custom-implemented within  and styled via  to ensure tight integration with the modern design language and avoid external library conflicts.
- **Backend-Frontend Integration**: All frontend actions (login, registration, adding teachers/students/lessons/enrollments, marking attendance, fetching stats/schedules) are fully integrated with the FastAPI backend, ensuring data persistence in MongoDB. The backend also handles complex logic like calculating lesson end times, managing lesson deductions, and enriching data with related names (e.g., teacher name for a lesson).
